Variable -> place to store value/information.

restriction of naming Variable:
1. must start with letter or underscore (cats / _cats)
2. rest of name must consist of letters, numbers, or underscore
3. case sensitive

Variable naming convention:
1. snake_case
2. camelCase
3. CAPITAL_SNAKE_CASE for constants
4. UpperCamelCase refers to Class
5. __test__ (dunder) for private variable


common variable data types in python:
1. bool => True or False
2. int => integer => (3,4,5)
3. str => string => "dummy"
4. list / array => [1,2,3]
5. dict / object => {"first_name" : "damenta"}

dynamic typing:
variables can change types (inter-data type)


Special Values in Variable (None):
Version of NULL in python


Declaring Strings (Double vs Single Quotes):
1. Does not really matter

String Escape Characters:
1. Using backslash following with any code (Ex : \n => enter new line)

String Concatenation (Adding strings together):
1. Only working with strings (if 8 + "hello" => not working)
2. can use += between strings in variable


String Formatting (using F function in python > 3.6 version):
guess = 8
print(f"your guess is {guess}")

For (Python 2 -> 3.5) => using .format method
print("Your guess is {}".format(10))


String and Indexes (Indicies):
name = "damenta"
name[0] = "d"
name[1] = "a"
name[-1] = "a" -> from the back of the strings

Converting data types in Python:
1. In str interpolation all converted into string
2. convert float to int => int(12.34) => 12
3. convert to string => str(123) => "123"
4. convert to float => float(12) => 12.0
