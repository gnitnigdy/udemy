React is extremely popular, declarative, component-based, state driven Javascript Library for Building user interfaces created by Facebook.

Component based design:
Components are the building blocks of the user interfaces in React.

Declarative means:
1. Describing how components look like and how they work using a declarative syntax called JSX.
2. Telling react what a component should look like based on current data/state.
3. React is abstraction away from DOM: we never touch the DOM.
4. Using JSX means a syntax that combines HTML, CSS, Javascript as well referencing other components.


State driven:
Rendering something to browser by change of state.
REACT reacts to state changes by re-rendering the UI.
